Requirements

The application should run from the command line, accept user actions
and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:

    Add, Update, and Delete tasks --> generate a
    User Class: id, name
    Interface Operations: subclass Implement Add, Update, Delete
    Service Class for select the various operations
    Mark a task as in progress or done
    Task Class: Map<task, status>
    Status static class with DONE or in progress
    List all tasks

    List all tasks that are done

    List all tasks that are not done

    List all tasks that are in progress

Here are some constraints to guide the implementation:

    You can use any programming language to build this project.

    Use positional arguments in command line to accept user inputs.

//    Use a JSON file to store the tasks in the current directory.
    CREATE A JSON THAT USE THE task class to store the name

    The JSON file should be created if it does not exist.

    Use the native file system module of your programming language to interact with the JSON file.

    Do not use any external libraries or frameworks to build this project.

    Ensure to handle errors and edge cases gracefully
